        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <h2>My name is Batya Menucha Cooper</h2>


        <p>I am 19 years old and this is my second year in Eretz Yisrael. Last year I went to Binas Bais Yaakov in Harnof for seminary and now I am back for the second year- Havineini- until Pesach iy''H. I really love being in Eretz Yisrael and I am so grateful that I got to come back for another year!</p>

        <p>My favorite activities to do on a rainy day are:
            <ul>
                <li>paint</li>
                <li>listen to music</li>
                <li>read books</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
