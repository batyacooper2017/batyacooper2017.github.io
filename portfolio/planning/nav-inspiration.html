        <p> I like how they divide it up into 2 navs- the top and the bottom. I would also like to have pictures of children showing their art pieces. I don't know if I would divide it up into two but I like some of the titles that they give which I will use.

        <p> I like the kiddy feel to the font of the subjects in the nav. It makes the page feel cute, artsy and fun. I wouldn't put any animal in- instead I'll have pictures of children with their art pieces like the webpage before. </p>

        <p> I really like it how they have a brush stroke next to each title in the nav. It really brings the artsy feel to the page. I am thinking of maybe putting the brush strokes next to each of the titles and when you hover over the brush stroke, the menu shows up. Also, I wouldn't not put each one into a box because it's too confining. </p>
